I am currently a postdoctoral researcher in the Discrete Technology & Production Automation (DTPA) group at the University of Groningen. I earned my PhD from the Bernoulli Institute for Mathematics, Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence, under the supervision of Prof. Dimka and Prof. George Azzopardi. Prior to that, I completed my Master's degree at the University of Science and Technology of China and my Bachelor's degree at Sichuan University.â€‹

My research interests lie at the intersection of Artificial Intelligence, Healthcare, and Human-Machine Interaction. With a strong foundation in AI and computer science, I am passionate about developing innovative solutions to complex challenges, particularly in advancing AI applications within the healthcare sector.

Here are some of my projects:
