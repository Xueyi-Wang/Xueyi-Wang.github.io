Developed an end-to-end health prediction system using smartwatch data. Proposed an Adaptive Spatial-Temporal Interpretable framework for accurate stress and sleep prediction despite data sparsity. Adapts to diverse user profiles (age, gender, behavior) to mitigate domain shift, while revealing key contributing factors for personalized health recommendations.
