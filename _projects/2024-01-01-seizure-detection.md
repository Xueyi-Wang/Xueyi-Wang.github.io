**Duration**: 2024 -- 2025

**Role**: Algorithm developer for multimodal fusion and model compression.

**Collaborators**: International collaboration with KU Leuven, UCL, Aarhus University, and clinical sites across Europe (EU multi-center clinical project).

## Overview

Participated in the EU multi-center clinical project **SeizeIT2**, an international collaboration aimed at developing next-generation wearable seizure detection systems. The project collected **11,640 hours** of continuous monitoring data from **125 epilepsy patients** across four modalities: EEG, ECG, EMG, and accelerometer.

Developed attention-based multimodal deep learning algorithms for neurophysiological signal analysis, with cross-modal feature fusion strategies to improve seizure detection accuracy and robustness. Explored model compression techniques to enable deployment on resource-constrained edge devices.

## Deliverables

- Lightweight seizure detection model optimized for edge deployment.
- Internal technical report delivered to consortium partners.
