**Duration**: 2025 -- Present

**Role**: Lead researcher of work package 4: smart data for data analysis and predictive modeling.

**Collaborators**: Menzis (Dutch health insurance company); Prof. dr. Claudine Lamoth (Professor of Movement Analysis & Smart Technology in Aging, Dept. of Human Movement Sciences, UMCG).

## Overview

This project centers on the **SamenGezond** ("Healthy Together") platform, a large-scale preventive health program operated by Menzis. Launched in July 2012 as a website and expanded with a mobile app in October 2017, the platform promotes healthy behaviors across physical activity, nutrition, mental health, sleep, and stress management through a points-based reward system.

## Dataset

- **Observation period**: July 2012 -- September 2019 (376 weeks, ~7.2 years)
- **Participants**: 83,466 consented adults (from ~838,500 enrolled users), aged 18--80 (mean 46.5 years), 56% female
- **Average enrollment duration**: ~3.6 years per participant
- **Temporal granularity**: Weekly

**Data modalities include**:
- Demographics (age, gender)
- Wearable sensor recordings (physical activity, sleep, heart rate)
- Health surveys and questionnaires
- Platform interaction logs (GPS-tracked exercises, goal-setting, AI coaching, social challenges)
- Insurance records
- Neighborhood-level socioeconomic status (NSES), derived from 9 indicators via the Dutch Central Bureau of Statistics
- Marketing campaign temporal markers (radio, TV, web)

## Key Characteristics

- **Participant typology**: Four adoption types identified based on website-only vs. website+app usage patterns before and after the mobile app launch.
- **Socioeconomic stratification**: Participants stratified into NSES quintiles, enabling analysis of health behavior adoption across socioeconomic segments.
- **Naturalistic design**: Observational (non-experimental), capturing genuine user decision-making and adoption behaviors.
- **Ethics**: Voluntary informed consent; IRB-approved by the University of Groningen; reported following STROBE guidelines.
