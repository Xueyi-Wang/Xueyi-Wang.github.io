**Duration**: 2025

Co-developed an Arduino-Unity-based rehabilitation game integrating sensors for real-time motion recognition on resource-constrained edge devices. Supports customizable rehabilitation targets, on-device model inference, and gamified home-based exercise without clinical supervision. Presented and demonstrated at the International Student Congress of (bio)Medical Sciences (ISCOMS) workshop 2025.
